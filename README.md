# Some Classic Algorithms
After watching a BBC(Open University) programme on Algorithms, I dug out some of the old ones I did in various languages, stored on various hard disks.

- Sieve of Eratostophenes (c, java)
- Euclid Algorithm/Greatest Common Divisor (Perl, Java, C)
- Bubble Sort (Perl, Java)
- Stable Marriage Problem
- Finite Differnce Method
