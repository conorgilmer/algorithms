#Random Numbers
Just a test of various programming languages generating Random Numbers and seeing how random they actually are. A lot of them are dependent on the hardware, or interpretor or compiler that us used.

The below randoms programs generate random integers between 1 and 10 and calculate how often numbers occur in 50 iterations.
- randoms.c (not that random same number each time run)
- randoms.pas (not that random same number each time run)
- Randoms.java (more random different numbers each time it is run)
