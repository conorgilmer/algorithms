#Euclids Algorithm or Greatest Common Divisor Problem

- gcd.pl 
- euclid.c (using 3 different methods)
- Euclid.java (using 3 different methods)

The c and java versions show 3 different functions which calculate the gcd, tow are loops (a while loop, and a do-while/do-until loop), the third version is a function which recursively calls itself, this is a very neat way to do it but it takes a bit of thought to get your head around the recursive call.
