# Relaxation Algorithm - Finite Difference Method(FDM)
Using the Relaxation Algorithm/Finite Difference Method, numerical processes to solve differential equations.
Solving Laplaces Equation


Potential(p) at a point is relative to the potential of the surrounding points

p = ( ( (x-1,y-1) + (x-1,y+1) + (x+1,y-1) + (x+1,y+1) ) / 4)
